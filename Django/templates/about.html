At <em>GoodLife</em>, we realize that news stations and other media platforms have helped people discover important issues in their own communities and beyond. However, it can be hard to find reliable and trustworthy platforms to donate money and time. </p>

<div style = "margin-left: 4%; margin-right: 4%;text-align: justify;" class = "actions">
  <p> There are countless communities across the globe where people do not have access to basic resources and services like clean water or medical assistance. Millions of people today suffer from malnutrition, dysentary, and other awful conditions solely because they do not have access to the basic necessities that most people take for granted. </p>

 <p> In areas like these, people not only struggle to find food and water but they are also forced to live in areas plagued with disease. According to the <a href = "https://www.kff.org/global-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-global-hivaids-epidemic/#:~:text=South%20Africa%20has%20the%20highest,in%20Western%20and%20Central%20Africa." style="text-decoration: none;">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, there are 7.5 million people in South Africa with HIV. HIV itself is one of the most serious and concerning epidemics in the world. In communities where healthcare is scarce, people have no choice but to just deal with the consequences and focus on living off the little that they do have.  </p>

 <p> Even beyond the pressing issue of the lack of survival essentials, another major social dilemma is the prevalence of inequality and discrimination towards different races, religions, and other groups. </p>

 <p> In the United States, there are major widespread protests advocating for justice in the black community through the BLM, or Black Lives Matter movement. There continues to be an underlying issue of systematic racism within the police department that prevents innocent African Americans from living their lives as an American citizen without constant fear. </p>

 <p> There are a lot of other situations just like this both within and beyond the US such as the Muslim concentration camps in China or the stigma and discrimination towards the disabled community worldwide. </p>
